# MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline

This NuGet package is intended to be used with the MonoGame Content Pipeline. You'll need to 
make some changes to your Content Pipline file (usually Content.mgcb) for everything to work
properly.

Add a reference to the `MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll` now installed in your `packages` folder
to the [MonoGame Content Pipeline tool](http://www.monogame.net/documentation/?page=Pipeline). 

You can do this either with the Reference Editor in the GUI or by manually adding a reference line to
your `Content.mgcb` file.

**Remember**: the versions need to match exactly for everything to work.

wiki page.
