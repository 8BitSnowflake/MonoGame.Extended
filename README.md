# MonoGame.Extended

[![Build Status](http://build.craftworkgames.com/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:MonoGameExtended_CI)/statusIcon)](http://build.craftworkgames.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=MonoGameExtended_CI&guest=1)

MonoGame.Extended is an open source extension library for [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/). It is a collection of classes and extension methods to make it easier to make games with MonoGame. It makes MonoGame more awesome.

## Development status

MonoGame.Extended is a work in progress. New classes are being added almost every day and I'm blogging about them on [dylanwilson.net](http://dylanwilson.net/). We have a very early [alpha Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MonoGame.Extended/) released but keep in mind the API is likely to change as the project grows.

## Design goals

 - A clean and consistent API familiar to MonoGame devleopers.
 - It's *not* a game engine, but extends the framework with code to make games.
 - Follows [C# coding guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229002(v=vs.110).aspx).
