# MonoGame.Extended

MonoGame.Extended is an open source extension library for [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/). It contains a collection of classes and extension methods that provide functionality MonoGame doesn't provide out of the box.

## Development status

MonoGame.Extended is a work in progress. I'm adding new classes to it almost every day and [blogging about them here](http://dylanwilson.net/). At this stage of the project the API is not set in stone, in particular,namespaces are likely to change as the project grows.

## Contributing

What I'm looking for most at this stage is an open discussion about what should be included in the library and how to design a consistent API that makes sense to MonoGame developers. If you've got any thoughts at all about the project, please raise an issue here on github or comment on [my blog](http://dylanwilson.net/).

Of course, you can also make a fork of the project and have a play with it. If you find any bugs or even want to add a new features this is the way to do it. I'll be accepting pull requests, as long as there's a reasonable discussion it first. It's important to keep the API and code quality consistent.
